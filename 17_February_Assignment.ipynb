    "**MongoDB** is a popular **NoSQL (non-relational)** database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called **BSON** (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making it highly scalable and suitable for modern applications.\n",

    "### **What Are Non-Relational Databases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-relational databases** (or NoSQL databases) are databases that do not use the traditional table-based schema of relational databases. Instead, they store data in various formats like:\n",
    "1. **Document-based** (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB)\n",
    "2. **Key-value pairs** (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)\n",
    "3. **Graph-based** (e.g., Neo4j)\n",
    "4. **Column-family stores** (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features of Non-Relational Databases:**\n",
    "- **Schema flexibility**: No fixed schema; data structures can evolve over time.\n",

    "   - Use cases like IoT, social media platforms, and analytics where real-time data processing is crucial.\n",

    "   - MongoDB provides excellent support for geospatial queries, making it ideal for location-based applications.\n",
